# Using OpenLayers 8 with React Functional Components and Hooks

Here is a sample application that demonstrates how to integrate OpenLayers with React Functional Components including:

* creating a wrapper component ([MapWrapper.js](https://github.com/tcallsen/react-func-openlayers/blob/master/src/components/MapWrapper.js))
* using hooks to initialize the map and add features from props
* get/set component state from within an OpenLayers event handler using refs
* Fetch and parse GeoJSON features from a mock API (done inside [App.js](https://github.com/tcallsen/react-func-openlayers/blob/master/src/App.js))

## Install

Install the dependencies with the following command:

`npm install`

## Launch with Development Server

To run a development build and launch the development server, execute:

`npm start`

Once completed, the app should be avialable from http://localhost:3000/

## Development Environment

This application was developed using create-react-app, with Node version v18.18.2

## Supplemental Blog Post

Here is a blog post I created that explains the integration in further detail: [https://taylor.callsen.me/using-openlayers-with-react-functional-components/](https://taylor.callsen.me/using-openlayers-with-react-functional-components/)
